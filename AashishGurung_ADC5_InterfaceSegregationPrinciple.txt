Interface segregation principle:
	Interface segregation principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not
use. It means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones which ensure that implementing
classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them. These types of
shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces. For example, A system may become so coupled at
multiple levels that it is no longer possible to make a change in one place without necessitating many
additional changes so by using an interface can prevent this side effect.
