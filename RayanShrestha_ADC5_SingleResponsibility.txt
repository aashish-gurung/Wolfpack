1. SOLID principle:
 1.1. S(Single-Responsibily Principle):
	The Single Responsibility Principle requires that a class should have only one job. So if a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.

Example_1:
	Class with two responsibilities:

class  Student:

    def __init__(self, std_name):
        self.std_name = std_name
    

    def get_name(self):
        pass


    def save(self, std_detail):
        pass

Example_2:
	Responsibilities divided into two different classes:


class Student:

    def __init__(self, std_name):
            self.std_name = std_name
    

    def get_name(self):
        pass


class StudentDB:

    def get_student(self, id):
        pass


    def save(self, std_detail):
        pass
