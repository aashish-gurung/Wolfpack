Solid principle 
Dependency Inversion Principle
The main thing that this principle states is that:
"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."
or simply put: "Depend on Abstractions, not on concretions."
High level modules tend to become more functional and reusable if they are not linked/dependant to 
lower level modules.
