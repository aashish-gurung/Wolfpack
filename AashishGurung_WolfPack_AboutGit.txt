Git Basics:
	
Git clone:
	Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned 
repository and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active 
branch.
git push:
	
Git pull:
	The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits 
from your local repository to a remote repo.

Merge conflict:
	The git merge command's primary responsibility is to combine separate branches and resolve any conflicting edits.
	
Git commit:
	The git commit command will save all staged changes, along with a brief description from the user, in a “commit” to the local repository.
